What a wonderful book, it inspired me a lot. It revolves aorund the main idea that *Believe you can succeed and you will*. 

## Summary
- Success is determined not so much by the size of one's brain as it is by the size of one's thinking.
- All of us, more than we recognize, are products of the thinking around us.
- Milton, author of *Paradise Lost*: "The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven."
- Philosopher Disraeli: "Life is too short to be little."
- Believe you can succeed and you will: Belief triggers the power to do.
- Don't sell yourself short, never ever sell yourself short.
- We belong where we want to go.

### HOW TO DEVELOP THE POWER OF BELIEF
1. Think success, don't think failure.
2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are.
3. Believe Big.

### CURE YOURSELF OF EXCUSITIS, THE FAILURE DISEASE
- The more successful the individual, the less inclined they are to make excuses.
- The right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.
- It's better to wear out than rust out.
- The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you have.
- Knowledge is power only when put to use-and then only when the use made of it is constructive.
- Never underestimate your own intelligence, and never overestimate the intelligence of others.
- When you beat down your fears of age limitations, you add years to your life as well as success.

### BUILD CONFIDENCE AND DESTROY FEAR

- Hope is a start. But hope needs action to win victories.
- Don't build mental monsters. Refuse to withdraw the unpleasant thoughts from your memory bank.

#### 2 step procedure to cure fear and win confidence:
1. Isolate your fear. Determine exactly what you are afraid of.
2. Then take action. There is some kind of action for any kind of fear.

### How to Think Big
- To think big, we must use words and phrases that produce big, positive mental images.
- Use bright, cheerful, favorable words and phrases to describe other people.
- Use positive language to encourage others. Compliment people personally at every opportunity.
- Use positive words to outline plans to others.
- Look at things not as they are, but as they can be. Visualization adds value to everything. A big thinker always visualizes what can be done in the future.
- When you feel like taking negative action, ask yourself, "Is it really important?"


#### "practice adding value" exercises.
1. Practice adding value to things: Ask yourself, "What can I do to 'add value' to this room or this house or this business?"
2. Practice adding value to people: "What can I do to 'add value' to my teammates? What can I do to help them to become more effective?" 
**To bring out the best in a person, you must first visualize their best.**
3. Practice adding value to yourself: "What can I do to make myself more valuable today?" Visualize yourself not as you are but as you can be. Then specific ways for attaining your potential
value will suggest themselves.

### Think and dream creatively
Creative thinking is simply fmding new, improved ways to do anything.

- Believe it can be done.
  - When we believe. our mind finds ways to do. Your mind will create a way if you let it.
  - "Man belongs," says Dr. von Braun, "where man wants to go."
- Don't let tradition paralyze your mind. Be receptive to new ideas. Be experimental. Try new approaches. Be progressive in everything you do.
Nothing grows in ice. If we let tradition freeze our minds, new ideas can't sprout.
  - Become receptive to ideas. Welcome new ideas. **Destroy these thought repellents: "Won't work," "Can't be done," "It's useless," and "It's stupid."**
  - Be an experimental person. Break up fixed routines.
  - Be progressive, not regressive. 
 - Ask yourself daily, "How can I do better?" It isn't so much what you know when you start that matters. 
 It's what you learn and put to use after you open your doors that counts most." 
  - **I can do better** attitude.
  - Capacity is a state of mind. How much we can do depends on how much we think we can do. When you really believe you can do more, your mind thinks creatively and shows you the way.
 - Practice asking and listening. Ask and listen, and you'll obtain raw material for reaching sound decisions. 
 Remember: Big people monopolize the listening; small people monopolize the talking.
 - Stretch your mind. Get stimulated. Associate with people who can help you tbink of new ideas, new ways of doing things. Mix with people of different occupational and social interests.

#### Harness and develop your ideas:
- Don't let ideas escape. Write them down.
- Review your ideas.
- Cultivate and fertilize your idea.

### You are what you think you are
- Thinking does make it so. Others See in us what we see in ourselves, We receive the kind of treatment we think we deserve.
- How you think determines how you act. How you act in turn determiues: How others react to you.
- Dress like a winner - Pay twice as much and buy half as many.
- A person who thinks his job is important receives mental signals on how to do his job better; And a better job means More promotions, more money, more prestige, more happiness.
- The way we think toward our jobs determines how our subordinates think toward their jobs.
- To be on top, you've got to feel like you're on top. Give yourself a pep talk and discover how much bigger and stronger you feel.
- Sell yourself to yourself
- Upgrade your thinking, think like important people think

### Manage your environment: Go First class
- The mind is what the mind is fed. Mind food is your environment - all the countless things that influeqce your conscious and subconscious thought.
- Recondition yourself for success - How we think is directly affected by the group we're in. Be sure you're in the flock that thinks right.
- Seek advice from people who know.
- Get plenty of psychological sunshine. Circulate in new groups. Discover new and stimulating things to do.
- Throw thought poison out of your environment. Avoid gossip. Talk about people, but stay on the positive side.
- Go first class in everything you do. You can't afford to go any other way.

### Make your attitudes your ally
- How we think shows through in how we act. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. They reflect thinking.
- We read attitudes through expressions and voice tones and inflections.
- When our attitude is right, our abilities reach a maximum of effectiveness and good results inevitably follow.

#### Grow these three attitudes
- I'm activated: To activate others, to get them to be enthusiastic, you must first be enthusiastic yourself.
   - To get enthusiasm about anything - people, places, things - dig into it deeper.
   - Say it with life. Put vitality into your speaking. Smile genuinly, show your teeth.
   - Broadcast good news - Transmit good news to the people you work with. Give them encouragement, compliment them at every opportnnity. Tell them about the positive things the company is doing. Listen to their problems. Be helpful. Encourage people and win their support. Pat them on the back for the job they're doing. Give them hope. Let them know you believe they can succeed, that you have faith in them. Practice relieving worriers.
- You are important: When you help others feel important, you help yourself feel important too.
  - practice appreciation 
  - Practice calling people by their names.
  - Don't hog glory, invest it instead. Praise is power. Invest the praise you receive from your superior. Pass praise on down to your subordinates, where it will encourage still greater performance.
- Service first: the seed of money is service. Always give people more than they expect to get.

### Think right towards people
- Being likable makes you lighter to lift.
- Take the initiative in building friendships.
- Refuse to let others prejudice your thinking.
- The person who does the most talking and the person who is the most successful are rarely the same person.
- Don't be a conversation hog. Listen, win friends, and learn.
- How you think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.

Remember Benjamin Fairless when things go wrong. Just do two things:
1. Ask yourself, "What can I do to make myself more deserving of the next opportunity?"
2. Don't waste time and energy being discouraged. Don't berate yourself. Plan to win next time.

### Get the action habit
- The test of a successful person is not an ability to eliminate all problems before they arise, but to meet and work out difficulties when they do arise.
- Give your ideas value by acting on them. Regardless of how good the idea, unless you do something with it, you gain nothing.
- Use action to cure fear and gain confidence. Rather than wait for the spirit to move you, sit down and move your spirit.
- Be a crusader. When you see something that you believe ought to be done, pick up the ball and run.

### How to turn defeat into victory
- Salvage something from every setback. We can turn setbacks into victories.
- Defeat is only a state of mind, and nothing more.
- Be constructively self-critical. Don't run away from inadequacies.
- Combine persistence with experimentation. If you aren't getting results, try a new approach.
- There is a good side in every situation. Find it. See the good side and whip discouragement.

### Use Goals to help you grow
- A goal is more than a dream; it's a dream being acted upon.
- The important thing is not where you were or where you are but where you want to get.
- Before you start out, know where you want to go.
- No one accomplishes more than he sets out to accomplish. So visualize a big future.
- Desire, when harnessed, is power. Failure to follow desire, to do what you want to do most, paves the way to mediocrity.
- Set goals: deadlines, target dates, self-imposed quotas. You will accomplish only what you plan to accomplish.
- Achieve your goal one step at a time. Regard each task you pelf arm, regardless of how small it may seem, as a step toward your goal.
- Take detours in stride. A detour simply means another route. It should never mean surrendering the goal.
- Invest in yourself. Purchase those things that build mental power and efficiency. Invest in education. Invest in idea starters.

### Think like a Leader
- Trade minds with the people you want to influence.
  - To get others to do what you want them to do, you must see things through their eyes.
- Think: What is the human way to handle this?
  - let your actions show you put people first.
  - Practice praising people.
- Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress.
   - Think improvement in everything you do.
   - Think high standards in everything you do.
- Take time out to confer with yourself and develop your supreme thinking power.
  - use solitude to put the pieces of a problem together, to work out solutions, to plan
  - spend some time alone every day just for thinking.
