# [Digital Minimalisation - Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World - by Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/)

One of the must read books in my opinion. I Picked up this book as the first book as part of my #100DaysOfReading effort and the timing could never had been more correct for reading this book

I started practicing the philosophy of digital minimalisation from that day itself, and hence I started getting more time to read and study. What a win!

## Below are my notes from this book:

- Modern digital life leads to exhaustion. The issue is less about the details, more about how it (social media consumption) has become beyond our control increasingly.
- Social media business plan - based on foundation of compulsive use
- Dark emotions get more attraction then positive and constructive thoughts. Repeated interaction with these exhaust users and affect their mood.
- digital minimalisation says - less is more, spend less time using technology. Take steps to extract the good from these technologies while sidestepping what’s bad.
- It’s not about usefulness, it’s about autonomy.
- Silicon valley is programming people, not apps. They want people to use the apps/ devices for long periods of time, and in prticular ways. That's how they make money.
- [Tristan Harris](https://www.tristanharris.com/) - whistleblower
- Bill Maher - [“The App Store wants your soul.”](https://www.thewrap.com/bill-maher-apple-google-facebook-addictive/)
- Adam Alter - “What’s the single biggest factor shaping our lives today?” - our screens (he kept playing 2048 game during 6 hours of his flight)
- Addiction is a condition in which a person engages in use of a substance or in a behavior for which the rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeatedly pursue the behavior despite detrimental consequences.
behavioral (like connected to tech) addictions resemble substance (like drugs) addictions in many domains.
- When notification symbol for facebook was blue, it was rarely used, when the color was changed to red (color of alarm), the clicks skyrocketed.
- How will a person keep using an app / or website - they need a dopamine hit every once in a while - via some like, share, an link which makes us laugh, cry or brings out strong emotions. The feedback is unpredictable for users and it makes them addicted to use
crave for approval from other people - social-validation feedback loop
- *Important* - the concern is not really about whether or not technologies are useful. It’s instead about autonomy. They are controlling more and more of our time, how we feel, how we think and how we behave.


### The effectiveness of digital minimalisation rests on three core principles:
1. Clutter is costly.
2. Optimization is important.
3. Intentionality is satisfying.

#### 1st law: Thoreau says
keep calculating, keep weighing. What exactly do I gain, or lose? (By using twtter for hours we might gain few interesting leads, but we also lose hours of our life, which could have been utilised in some more meaningful way)
He asks us to treat minutes of our life as a concrete and valuable substance - the most valuable substance we possess - and to always reckon with how much of this life we trade for the various activities we allow to claim our time.
the cumulative cost of the noncrucial things we clutter our lives with can far outweigh the small benefits each individual piece of clutter promises.

**the law of diminishing returns** 

*Note:* I love the way economics has been used to explain certain factors, it fits perfectly :)

#### 2nd law: 
Focus not only on what tech to use/adopt, but also on how to use them in optimized way.

Approaching decisions with intention can be more important than the impact of the actual decisions themselves.

**Amish philosophy: Intention trumps convenience**

#### To allow an optional technology back into life at the end of the digital declutter, it must:
1. Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough).
2. Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better).
3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.

### Solitude
- Everyone benefits from regular doses of solitude - give your brain the regular doses of quiet it requires to support a monumental life.
- solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. It is a subjective state in which the mind is free from inputs from other mind.
- solitude is valuable - because from a unhurried self-reflection comes the insight and emotional balance
- when you avoid solitude, you miss out on the positive things it brings you: 
   * the ability to clarify hard problems, 
   * to regulate your emotions, 
   * to build moral courage, and
   * to strengthen relationships.
   
**humans are not wired to be constantly wired**

- smartphones are the primary enabler of solitude deprivation - couldn't agree more
- walking is a high-quality source of solitude - true, I have personally experienced it
- Writing a letter to yourself - provides a conceptual scaffolding on which to sort and organize thinking
- When given downtime, in other words, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life


#### Conversation office hours strategy
Put aside set times on set days during which you’re always available for conversation.

Leisure Lessons:
1. Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.
2. Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world.
3. Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.

To escape the drain of low-value digital habits, it’s important to first put in place high-quality leisure activities.

### Key to sustained success with the philosophy of digital minimalisation
- schedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure - like social media, binge watching, video games
- **attention economy** describes the business sector that makes money gathering consumers’ attention and then repackaging and selling it to advertisers.
- the smartphone versions of social media services are much more adept at hijacking your attention than the versions accessed through a web browser on your laptop or desktop
- **the idea of endlessly surfing your feed** - is an act of being used by these services instead of using them to your own advantage

If you can, dumb down the smartphone. replace it with a phone which makes just phone calls and text messages.

The key to sustained success with this philosophy of digital minimalisation is accepting that 

**it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.**
