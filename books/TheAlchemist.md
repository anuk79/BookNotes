# [The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist)

The book surrounds around: when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. 

Through a simple yet beautifully woven and meticulously narrated story, the author shows us the essence of life and the destiny which we can fulfill by believing in ourselves and the journey.


And it reiterates on the fact that when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.

*****

It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.

*****

It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.

*****

When someone sees the same people every day, they wind up becoming a part of that person's life. 

And then they want the person to change. If someone isn't what others want them to be, the others become angry. 

Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.

*****

At a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. **That's the world's greatest lie.**

*****

There is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It's your mission on earth.

*****

The Soul of the World is nourished by people's happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. 

To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation. All things are one.

**"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."**

*****

"If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work toward getting it."

*****

When each day is the same as the next, it's because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.

*****

The principle of favorability: When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. It is also called the Beginner's luck.

*****

Why is there a Begineer's luck?

"Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny; it whets your appetite with a taste of success."

*****

Don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion.

*****

The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.

*****

How normally people perceive the world: I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.

*****

He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and weren't really new, but that he had never perceived before. 
And he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them. 

He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.

*****

Making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.

*****

If I could, I'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence. It's with those words that the universal language is written.

*****

The closer one gets to realizing his destiny, the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being.

*****

**Learn from everyone and everything**

He thought: I've learned things from the sheep, and I've learned things from crystal. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.

*****

Hunches: the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people.

*****

Intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, 
and we are able to know everything, because it's all written there.

*****

People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.

*****

We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it's our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.

*****

When you can't go back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward.

*****

Everyone has his or her own way of learning things.

*****

If you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man.

Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we're living right now

*****

When you are in love, things make even more sense.

*****
Why should we not worry about future?

"If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise," said the seer. "If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur."

*****

The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. 

Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity."

**Maktub** - loved this word which was spread acoss book, It is an Arabic word that stands for, **it is written**

*****

Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.

*****

The boy had met the alchemist.

*Note*: This was one of the most beautiful moments in the book, and I felt tears rolling down my eyes while reading that, and I re-read that, for maybe 4-5 times.

*****

"It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil," said the alchemist. "It's what comes out of their mouths that is."

*****

Wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure 

You've got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.

*****

Love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny. If he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't true love - the love that speaks the Language of the World."

*****

One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.

*****

If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back.

If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.

*****

"There is only one way to learn," the alchemist answered. "It's through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey.

*****

Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.

*****

People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.

*Note*: This hit hard, isn't it something we always know deep in our heart and yet we are afraid to pursue those dreams.

*****

Very few follow the path laid out for them â€” the path to their destinies, and to happiness. 

Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.

*****

Every search begins with beginner's luck. And every search ends with the victor's being severely tested.

*Note*: This is one of the post powerful messages which I felt in this book. We must prove ourselves worthy in orther to pursue what we are looking for. *Cannot end this note without the reference of the Thor's hammer.*ðŸ˜Ž

*****

One of life's simple lessons, the alchemist answered - "is that When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed."

*****

Your eyes show the strength of your soul.

*****

They found the Philosopher's Stone, because they understood that **when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well**

*****

There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve - the fear of failure.

*****

That's what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.

*****

But this payment goes well beyond my generosity," the monk responded.

"Don't say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the next time.

*Note*: Heh, I will remember this forever. I have told this multiple times, but never again. Be grateful and thank the life for whatever we get, and never question that decision.

*****

Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.

*****

No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.

*****

Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That's where I am, and that's where your treasure is.

*****

**Life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny.**
