# Book Notes
I love reading books. Recently I started the challenge #100DaysOfreading so that I can resume my habit of daily reading. I always have habit of bookmarking the lines and quotes I loved and/or found beautiful while reading.

## Why this repo:
This contains the quotes and notes which I take while reading any book. There are lots of tiny things which I love and would like to remember by going through them again. Hence I have started taking notes. These are direct quotes from the books, sometimes altered to fit more context together. 
<br />
<br />
I created this repo in public for multiple reasons:
- I would like to go through the learnings again.
- If you are trying to pick your next book to read, you could go through the notes to see if it interests you.
- If you want to read a summary of these books, you can refer to it.

You can click on the book name from the list below and read the notes for it.
